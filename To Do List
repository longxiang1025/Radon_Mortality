Regional Radon Model to-do list
1. Develop a shortened parameter table and list, consisting of 2 random forest, 2 neural network, 2 deep learning, 1 gam, 1 robust linear regression (8 models)
2. Develop a parameter table of bandwidth (25000 [25km], 100000 [100km], 200000[200km]) and number of neighbours selected [5000, 10000, 15000]
3. Combine these two tables together and get a combined table of 72 rows.
++ It seems that current solution: using all measurements from a zipcode as test and all other measurements as training, can lead to biased estimation in most cases. To address this, further division is unavoidable. That's a spatio-temporal ranfom forest.
1. Develop a prototype of spatial-temporal random forest model.
++ It seems that the current performance of spatio-temporal random forest is not that good. Current three parameters: (spatial/temporal ratio: 10000, relative decay in kernel: 2, number of neighbours: 5000), seems producing fine results in major metropolitan areas in New England and Midwest. However, there're some regions (lower left of Midwest and Northeastern PA) with high MAE and mean residual. The overall R2 in basement is 0.732^2, and R2 in upstiars is 0.667^2.
1. Change the parameter: increaes the relative decay in kernel to 4 from 2. This adjustment will give more weight to "closer" measurements.
2. Have a retrospecive look at the performance of general random forest model (1_135). Perhaps it has done well enough.
