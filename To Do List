1.Re-group the radon measurements by season instead of by month to increase representativity
2.Extract soil moisture information onto prediction model.
3.Extract precipitation, air pressure, soil temperature and mosisture information onto prediction model.
4.Run an ensemble learning instead of relying on a single model
5.
