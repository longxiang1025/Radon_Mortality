1.Re-group the radon measurements by season instead of by month to increase representativity[Done].
2.Extract soil information onto prediction model[Done].
3.Extract precipitation, air pressure, soil temperature and mosisture information onto prediction model [Done].
4.Run an ensemble learning instead of relying on a single model[].
5.Replace numeric mean with geometric mean [Done].
6.Add number of units observed as weight in model training [Done].
7.Create a parameter table/list for base learning method training [Done].
8.Nerual Network algorithm doesn't work on the original scale of geometric mean. I log transformed it during model training. It should be converted back during prediction.
9. Ideas about plot/table:
 9.1: A flowchart of ensemble learning model
 9.2: Histogram of number of measurements per zipcode/ Histogram of observation ratio per zipcode
 9.3: A summary table of radon measurements grouped by State/Season/Year ranges (Geometric mean +/- SD, # of obs, # of zipcodes with > 10 obs)
 9.4: A map of accumulated # of obs in each zipcode, maybe we can calculate the % of buildings measured, so this's a pair of maps (create a table for this as supplementary)
 9.5: A group of maps showing the trends of key predictors (Uranium, Thorium, Building Ages, Percent of Surf_42, Soil porosity, Soil moisture)
 9.6: A map of study region with accumulated # of obs per zipcode as background, overlayers inlcude Faults, state, counties, zipcode polygons. On the right of map, plot a vertical histgram
      showing the geometric mean and IQR of county-level radon obs, ranked by the percent of properties get tested.
 9.7: A scatter plot predicted rn and observed rn with area proportional to number of units tested, and six scatter plots of base learners (simple scatter plots).
 9.8: A summary table of key factors and their association with radon.
 9.9: A wide matrix (3*5) of figures showing the average of (1991-2000, 2001-2010, 2011-2019), spring, summer, autumn and winter radon levels.
 9.10: A table of variable importance in each base learners (supplementary)
 9.11: A table of subset analysis, the CV-R2 for each state and each season
